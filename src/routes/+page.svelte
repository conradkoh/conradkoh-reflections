		<p>Words are an old tradition.</p>
		<p>
			As with any tradition, it may have a stale taste, or a musty smell. Yet perhaps like stepping
			into an antique shop, a sense of wonder remains, for the hope of knowledge existed before, but
			now forgotten.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is still much to be remember. These words bear a hope of a day where they will be called
			to recollection.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is my recitation, my reflection, my attempt to remember. I hope you find something of use
			here.
