	<p>Words are an old tradition.</p>
	<p>
		As with any tradition, it have a stale taste, or a musty smell. Yet perhaps like stepping into a
		shop full of antiques, a sense of wonder remains, for the hope of knowledge existed before, but
		now forgotten.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is still much to be remember. And hopefully to one day be called to recollection by one
		who deems it worthy.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is my recitation, my reflection, my attempt to remember. I hope you find something of use
		here.
