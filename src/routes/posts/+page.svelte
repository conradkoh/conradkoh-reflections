				<h2>Sing A New Song</h2>
				<h3>Verse 1</h3>
				<p>
					Sing a new song, from the ends of the earth
					<br />From the islands, a song declaring your worth
					<br />Jesus, the lamb who was slain
				</p>
				<h3>Verse 2</h3>
				<p>
					Sing a new song, let creation be heard
					<br />Join the chorus, sung in heaven and earth
					<br /> Jesus, is coming again
				</p>
				<h3>Pre-Chorus</h3>
				<p>
					We'll lift the song until every nation sings
					<br />We're hastening the day of your appearing
					<br />From the rising of the sun to its setting
					<br />Your name will be praised
				</p>
				<h3>Chorus</h3>
				<p>
					Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
					<br /> Worth to receive all honor, power and praise
					<br /> Be exalted, King of Glory
					<br /> He's coming again
				</p>
				<h3>Bridge</h3>
				<p>
					Until the islands sing Your song
					<br />Until the closeness of Your law
					<br />Until we hear the desert sing
					<br />A song to welcome back the King
				</p>
				<p class="mt-4">
					Until the nations love Your Name
					<br />Until Jerusalem's a praise
					<br />Until we hear the final shout
					<br />The day we see You on the clouds
				</p>
			</Song>
			<Song>
				<h2>Tribe and Tongue</h2>
				<h3>Verse 1</h3>
				<p>
					I hear the sound of all creation groaning
					<br />For the revealing of the sons of God
					<br />I can hear the sound of nations crying
					<br />How long until You come
				</p>

				<h3>Verse 2</h3>
				<p>
					And I know this present suffering is
					<br />For a moment, it's not worth comparing
					<br />To the glory You've prepared for us
					<br />On the day when You come
				</p>
				<h3>Pre-Chorus</h3>
				<p>So we set our hope on what we cannot see</p>
				<h3>Chorus</h3>
				<p>
					No longer will You hear just the groans of creation
					<br />But every tribe and tongue singing Heaven's song
					<br />From the rising to the setting sun
					<br />We sing: "Glory to the Righteous One"
				</p>

				<h3>Bridge</h3>
				<p>
					One day You'll shake the nations
					<br />One day You'll split the skies
					<br />One day we'll hear the footsteps
					<br />Of Him who is to come
				</p>
				<p class="mt-3">
					One day we'll stand in glory
					<br />Before the throne of God
					<br />The King of heaven will reign
					<br />In all the earth
				</p>

				<h3>Chorus</h3>
				<p>
					No longer will You hear just the groans of creation
					<br />But every tribe and tongue singing Heaven's song
					<br />From the rising to the setting sun
					<br />We sing: "Glory to the Righteous One"
					<br />We sing: "Glory to the Righteous One"
				</p>

					Give it all for the dream of Your heart

					<br />To give it all
				</p>

				<h3>Bridge</h3>
				<p>
					I'll make it my ambition

					<br />Before the throne, before the Lamb
					<br />Hear creation crying, "Worthy"

				<h2>How Long (Song of the Martyrs)</h2>

				<h3>Refrain</h3>
				<p>
					How long 'til You come, till You come back?
					<br />How long 'til You split the sky?
					<br />How long 'til You come for Your people?
					<br />How long 'til You make all things right?
				</p>

				<h3>Verse 1</h3>
				<p>
					All the earth is longing for Your soon returning
					<br />And all creation groans until You come
					<br />The martyrs cry aloud, “How long, Lord Jesus?”
					<br />The Spirit and the Bride say, “Come.”
				</p>

				<h3>Chorus</h3>
				<p>
					Come Lord Jesus, come
					<br />King of glory come
					<br />Holy and true
					<br />How long 'til You make all things new?
				</p>

				<h3>Verse 2</h3>
				<p>
					We have overcome by the blood of Jesus
					<br />The testimony of what God has done
					<br />We won’t love our lives even unto death for
					<br />The victory over sin and death’s been won
				</p>

				<h3>Bridge</h3>
				<p>
					This momentary light affliction
					<br />Is working in me an eternal weight of glory
					<br />And in the waiting keep me steady
					<br />Until You come
				</p>
