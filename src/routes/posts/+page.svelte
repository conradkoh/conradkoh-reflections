			<h2>Sing A New Song</h2>
			<h3>Verse 1</h3>
			<p>
				Sing a new song, from the ends of the earth
				<br />From the islands, a song declaring your worth
				<br />Jesus, the lamb who was slain
			</p>
			<h3>Verse 2</h3>
			<p>
				Sing a new song, let creation be heard
				<br />Join the chorus, sung in heaven and earth
				<br /> Jesus, is coming again
			</p>
			<h3>Pre-Chorus</h3>
			<p>
				We'll lift the song until every nation sings
				<br />We're hastening the day of your appearing
				<br />From the rising of the sun to its setting
				<br />Your name will be praised
			</p>
			<h3>Chorus</h3>
			<p>
				Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
				<br /> Worth to receive all honor, power and praise
				<br /> Be exalted, King of Glory
				<br /> He's coming again
			</p>
			<h3>Bridge</h3>
			<p>
				Until the islands sing Your song
				<br />Until the closeness of Your law
				<br />Until we hear the desert sing
				<br />A song to welcome back the King
			</p>
			<p class="mt-4">
				Until the nations love Your Name
				<br />Until Jerusalem's a praise
				<br />Until we hear the final shout
				<br />The day we see You on the clouds

			<h2>Tribe and Tongue</h2>
			<h3>Verse 1</h3>
			<p>
				I hear the sound of all creation groaning
				<br />For the revealing of the sons of God
				<br />I can hear the sound of nations crying
				<br />How long until You come
			</p>

			<h3>Verse 2</h3>
			<p>
				And I know this present suffering is
				<br />For a moment, it's not worth comparing
				<br />To the glory You've prepared for us
				<br />On the day when You come
			</p>
			<h3>Pre-Chorus</h3>
			<p>So we set our hope on what we cannot see</p>
			<h3>Chorus</h3>
			<p>
				No longer will You hear just the groans of creation
				<br />But every tribe and tongue singing Heaven's song
				<br />From the rising to the setting sun
				<br />We sing: "Glory to the Righteous One"
			</p>

			<h3>Bridge</h3>
			<p>
				One day You'll shake the nations
				<br />One day You'll split the skies
				<br />One day we'll hear the footsteps
				<br />Of Him who is to come
			</p>
			<p class="mt-3">
				One day we'll stand in glory
				<br />Before the throne of God
				<br />The King of heaven will reign
				<br />In all the earth
			</p>

			<h3>Chorus</h3>
			<p>
				No longer will You hear just the groans of creation
				<br />But every tribe and tongue singing Heaven's song
				<br />From the rising to the setting sun
				<br />We sing: "Glory to the Righteous One"
				<br />We sing: "Glory to the Righteous One"

			<h2>Dream of Your Heart</h2>

			<h3>Verse 1</h3>
			<p>
				From the foundations
				<br />You have chosen us for your family
				<br />You have called us Your sons and daughters
				<br />For eternity
			</p>

			<h3>Pre-Chorus</h3>
			<p>Not my will but Yours be done</p>

			<h3>Chorus</h3>
			<p>
				Give it all for the dream of Your heart
				<br />Waste it all that You would have what You have wanted from the start
				<br />For the joy set before You there is nothing I won't do
				<br />Than to give it all
				<br />To give it all
			</p>

			<h3>Verse 2</h3>
			<p>
				It's Your desire that every people
				<br />Be with You where You are
				<br />Let songs of love rise
				<br />Fill every nation
				<br />Your pure and spotless Bride
			</p>

			<h3>Bridge</h3>
			<p>
				I'll make it my ambition
				<br />To live for Your commission
				<br />Make Your praise known Your Name alone
				<br />To every tribe and nation
				<br />Your sacred invitation
				<br />Make Your praise known Your name alone
